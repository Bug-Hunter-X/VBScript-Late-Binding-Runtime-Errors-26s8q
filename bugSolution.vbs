Early Binding: Declare object variables with their specific type. This allows the VBScript interpreter to verify the object and method existence at compile time rather than at runtime. This significantly improves error handling.
```vbscript
Dim obj As Object
On Error Resume Next  'Error handling is still good practice
Set obj = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
    MsgBox "Object creation failed: " & Err.Description
    WScript.Quit
End If
MsgBox obj.GetFile("\path\to\file.txt").Name
```
This improved version explicitly uses early binding.  The `On Error Resume Next` is still recommended for best practice, checking for errors immediately after the object creation.
